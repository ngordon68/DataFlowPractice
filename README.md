# To Do:

You can work on the steps either individually or with a team to try and solve the problems to make the app

# Step 1

 TODO: make a Fruit model that has a name, image, and descriptions
 > [!Bonus]
> * You can use more resouces to go through the activity.
 BONUS: try to make a property for the fruit color

# Step 2

TODO: Navigate to the FruitObject file and make an fruit array to holds a strawberry, blueberry, banana, peach, and an orange.

# Step 3

Go to the ContentView file and reference the FruitObject array to visually show the fruit list
